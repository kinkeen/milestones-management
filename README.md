# Milestones-Management

Milestones-Management is a Web based application for documenting communication for each milestone of a project, for example: documenting documents, pictures, videos and signatures between owner and builder during construction of a custom home
The purpose of the documentation is to clarify both parties meet the expectations, and to avoid misunderstandings and changes in the requirements during the project. The documentation will be in the end of each milestone and before the next milestone. The both sides can anytime  view what has been done.

+ The application can be suited for documenting the communication between a service provider and a service recipient during milestones of the project.  we will implement it to be generic.

+ Fllow the prenciple of D.R.Y (don't repeat yourself) we choose to use UI Kit called:
Prime React (https://primefaces.org/primereact/showcase/#/)

+ This project was created and published as a final project of Full Stack Developer training at Lighthouse Labs.

## Future modules 

+ In the future also possible to implement 
documenting communication between contractors and builder during the milestone and gives options to the builder to:
- contractors who work on milestone 
-  evaluate his expenses and profitability of the project
